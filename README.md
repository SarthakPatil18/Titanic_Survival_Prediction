🎯 Binary Classification | Logistic Regression | Learning Project
📌 About the Project
This project uses the Titanic dataset to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the disaster.

It was my first supervised ML project, and I followed a tutorial by NeuralNine to understand the process step by step.
Now, I’m revisiting it to explore new ideas, try different models, and improve the notebook using my own understanding.

✅ Current Status
This version is based on the **NeuralNine** tutorial on YouTube.
I’ve used it as a foundation and learning guide.
I'm now improving it by:

Adding more feature engineering

Testing new models

Writing clear explanations
